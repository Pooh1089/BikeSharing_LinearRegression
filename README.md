# BikeSharing Assignment
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues. They contacted a consulting firm to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends.The company wants to know:
  -Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
  -How well those variables describe the bike demands
We are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly change the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations.

## Steps for Model Building
1.Reading and Understanding Data 

2.Visualising the Data

3.Data Preparation
4.Splitting the Data into Training and Testing Sets
5.Rescaling the features
6.Building the Linear model
7.Residual Analysis of the train data
8.Making predictions using final model
9.Model Evaluation
10.Results
